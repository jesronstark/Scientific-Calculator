Overview

This is a feature-rich scientific calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all contained in a single file. The calculator includes standard arithmetic operations along with advanced scientific functions, a calculation history panel, and attractive animations.

Features
Core Functionality
Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

Clear (AC) and delete (DEL) functions

Decimal point input

Plus/minus toggle

Keyboard support

Scientific Functions
Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) with degree/radian mode

Logarithmic functions (log base 10, natural log)

Square root (√)

Power function (x^y)

Factorial calculation (x!)

Modulus operation (mod)

Mathematical constants (π)

Exponential functions (e^x, 10^x)

Parentheses for complex expressions

User Interface
Animated pop-in effect on load

Button ripple animations when clicked

Hover effects with slight elevation

Display shimmer animation

Color-coded buttons by function type

History panel showing previous calculations

Theme toggle (dark/light mode)

Responsive design

Technical Features
Single-file implementation (HTML, CSS, JS)

Clean, modular JavaScript code

Keyboard event support

Calculation history storage

Degree/radian mode toggle

How to Use
Basic Operations:

Click number buttons or type numbers to input values

Use operator buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) for calculations

Press "=" or Enter to compute results

Scientific Functions:

Enter a number first, then click the desired function button

For binary operations (x^y, mod), enter first number, click function, then enter second number

Special Features:

Click "DEG/RAD" to toggle between degree and radian modes for trig functions

Click "HIST" to view calculation history

Click the sun/moon icon to toggle between dark and light themes

Use "±" to toggle positive/negative values

"AC" clears everything, "DEL" removes last digit

Keyboard Shortcuts:

Numbers 0-9: Input numbers

. : Decimal point

+, -, *, / : Basic operators

Enter or = : Compute result

Backspace : Delete last digit

Escape : Clear all

h or H : Toggle history panel

Implementation Notes
All code is contained in a single HTML file

Uses vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries)

CSS variables for easy theme customization

Animation effects using CSS transitions and keyframes

Calculation history persists during session

Browser Compatibility
The calculator should work in all modern browsers including:

Chrome

Firefox

Safari

Edge

Opera

Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:

More advanced functions (hyperbolic, statistical)

Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)

Complex number support

Equation solver

Graphing capabilities

Save history between sessions
